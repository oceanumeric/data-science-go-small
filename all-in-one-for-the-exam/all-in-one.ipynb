    "> Small story (will not be tested in the exam): I had a talk with a person who is the principal data scientist and  working for the government. He told me that the government is implementing a strategy called \"AI in 2030\". The goal of this strategy is to make the government to be more data-driven and AI-driven. He told me that every year they have to pay a lot of money to consultancies such as Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to do data analysis for them. He said that the government now is planning to combine data scientist and ChatGPT to do the data analysis. They are hoping that they could reduce 40% of the cost by doing so. The idea is that they will only hire BCG for those very complex data analysis tasks. For those simple tasks, they will use AI to do the data analysis. The main tool that BCG uses is Excel, SQL and Tableau. They are all table-based tools. This means having a good understanding of table-based data analysis is very important. This is why we start from data.table."
