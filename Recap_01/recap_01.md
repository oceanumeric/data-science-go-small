# Recap 1.1 - Manage your codespaces :woman_office_worker:

- You can create maximum 2 codespaces in your account.
- You can only run 180 hours per month.
- Please try to use only 1 codespace for this course.
- Which one to use?
    - [DataLab-Template](https://github.com/oceanumeric/DataLab-Template)
    - I set up everything for you :blush:
      - There is no need to install anything.
      - There is no need to copy and past anything for shortcuts.
      - Easy to convert slides to pdf, pptx, html, etc.
